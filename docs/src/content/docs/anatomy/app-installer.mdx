The _app image_ still isn't distribution-ready and needs to be packaged to become easily distributable and downloadable.
An _app installer_ is a distributable package that contains the app and maybe guides through the installation process.
Each operating system has its specific app installer formats:

- Windows: self-extracting .exe or .msi installer file
- macOS: .dmg archive or .pkg installation package
- Linux: .deb or .rpm package

It is jpackage again that packages an _app image_ into an _app installer_.
Actually, jpackage can combine all three steps in one single shell command.
But splitting them into build steps improves caching, avoids work, and the _app image_ can be examined without installation.

The plugin adds an `appInstaller` task that runs jpackage with the app image as an input and puts the resulting installer under `build/jpackage/installer`.

The _app installer_ step requires native build tools being installed and configured correctly.
It is more fragile than the _app image_ step and might fail on the first try.
This is one more reason for splitting up the build process.

The installer can also get some customization options, but most work is done in the app image.
