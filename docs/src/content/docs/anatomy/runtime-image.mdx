There was a time when users had to install a Java runtime environment (JRE) before they could open a Java-based application.
This wasn't only annoying for users but it could lead to version conflicts when another app wasn't compatible with the installed JRe.

The solution: Each app should come with its own individual JRE bundled as part of the app.
This solves the compatibility conflicts because each app has a compatible JRE.
Such a bundled JRE is called a _runtime image_.
Physically seen, it is a folder where the content follows a certain file structure.

The [jlink] tool is responsible for generating runtime images and is included in the JDK since Java 9.
The plugin adds a `generateRuntimeImage` task to the build that produces a runtime image to be bundled with the application.

```shell title="Creating a new project"
gradlew.bat generateRuntimeImage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

```shell title="Creating a new project"
./gradlew generateRuntimeImage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The runtime image is stored under `build/jlink/runtime`.
It is an input for the next step.
