The next step is packaging the application into a self-contained executable.
This includes:

- The previously generated runtime image
- App-specific customizations and assets like icons and resources
- a launcher that runs Java with the correct arguments
- Non-modular jar files that are runtime dependencies of the app and couldn't be included in the linking step

The [jpackage] tool is responsible for this step.
It assembles everything into a specific folder structure that  tries to mimic how native apps are structured on the respective operating systems.
This is called an _app image_, a tool-specific format.
It has nothing to do with e.g. the Linux App Image format (which would be nice to have).

The plugin adds an `appImage` task that runs the jpackage tool and outputs the app image under `build/jpackage/image`.
It can directly be executed without having to install it somewhere on the system.
