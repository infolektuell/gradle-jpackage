description: How to add this plugin to a Gradle application project to get app executables and installers
---

Please make sure your application is a working Gradle project.
There shouldn't be any compilation errors, the app should build and run.

The minimal setup doesn't need any additional configuration.
The essentials are inferred from the Java and Application plugin.

### Applying the plugin

In `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` apply the plugin using the `plugins` DSL.
A minimal build script should contain these critical parts (adjusted according to your app):

<Tabs syncKey="dsl">
<TabItem label="Kotlin">

```kts ins={4} "applicationName" "mainClass"
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    application
    id("de.infolektuell.jpackage") version "x.y.z"
}

application {
  applicationName = "SampleApp"
  mainClass = "org.example.App"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Groovy">

```groovy ins={4} "applicationName" "mainClass"
// build.gradle
plugins {
    id application
    id 'de.infolektuell.jpackage' version 'x.y.z'
}

application {
  applicationName = 'SampleApp'
  mainClass = 'org.example.App'
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The plugin auto-detects whether the app is modular and reads the main module's name from the `module-info.java` file.
So the main module doesn't need to but can be explicitly set in the build script.

#### Creating an executable

To turn your app into a self-contained executable, run this task:

<Tabs syncKey="os">
<TabItem label="Windows">

```shell title="Creating a self-contained executable"
gradlew.bat appImage
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux">

```shell title="Creating a self-contained executable"
./gradlew appImage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After running successfully, the results can be found in the build directory:

<FileTree>

- app The project directory
  - build The build directory
    - ...
    - **jpackage**
      - image/ Contains the self-contained executable
    - ...
  - build.gradle.kts
- settings.gradle.kts

</FileTree>

The `build/jpackage/image` directory contains a directory named by the application name.
This directory contains the executable and required files, it can be copied anywhere and opened.
Its structure depends on the build OS.
On macOS, the folder structure follows the mac-specific application format,, its name has an `.app` suffix.
It is immediately recognized as an application and can be opened like usual macOS apps.

### Going further

Now you should have a minimal working setup.
The rest of this documentation describes how app customization can be achieved with this plugin.
