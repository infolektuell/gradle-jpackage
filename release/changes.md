- Added a jlink configuration to declare jlink-specific dependencies, e.g., .jmod files that should replace their jar equivalent that is used during development.
- The plugin is able to detect the main module, so it doesn't need to be set explicitly in the build script. Setting it saves a bit of build time, but it's not necessary.
